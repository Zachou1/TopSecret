         <strong>What meens hack(haking)</strong>
         <br>
         <i>A computer hacker is a computer expert who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means.
<br>
Though the term "hacker" has become associated in popular culture with a "security hacker" – someone who utilizes their technical know-how of bugs or exploits to break into computer systems and access data which would otherwise be unavailable to them – hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in legal situations.
<br>
For example, law enforcement agencies sometimes use hacking techniques in order to collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors.
<br>
This could include using anonymity tools (such as a VPN, or the dark web) to mask their identities online, posing as criminals themselves.
<br>
[1][2] Likewise, covert world agencies can employ hacking techniques in the legal conduct of their work.
<br>
Oppositely, hacking and cyber-attacks are used extra- and illegally by law enforcement and security agencies (conducting warrantless activities), and employed by State actors as a weapon of both legal and illegal warfare.
